# API Hero Quick Start

In this guide we'll cover integrating API Hero in your application

## Using `createFetch`

You can integrate API Hero in any application or SDK that works with the `fetch` standard, using the `createFetch` function in `@apihero/fetch`. For example, the Octokit.js SDK accepts a `fetch` method in it's configuration

### Install the package

First, install the `@apihero/fetch` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @apihero/fetch@latest
```

### Update your usage of Octokit.js

Octokit.js allows you to pass in a custom fetch function, to be used on all requests. Usage the `createFetch` method from `apihero/next`, passing in your project key:

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "@octokit/rest";
import { createFetch } from "@apihero/fetch";
const octokit = new Octokit({
  request: {
    fetch: createFetch({ projectKey: "hero_abc123" }),
  },
});
```

### Make some requests

Trigger requests and then visit app.apihero.run

## In a frontend application

You can easily integrate API Hero in an application that makes API requests from a frontend, for example in React or Vue, by using the `@apihero/worker` package and service workers.

API Hero makes use of Service Workers to intercept requests and forward them to the API Hero proxy at gateway.apihero.run (or your own self-hosted version).

The following steps will walk you through how to do it

### Run the init command

```bash
npx apihero init ./public --save
```

This will save the service worker code to your public directory.

### Configure the worker

```tsx
// src/worker.ts
import { setupWorker } from '@apihero/worker'

This configures a Service Worker with the given request handlers.
export const worker = setupWorker({ projectKey: "hero_abc123", domains: ["api.github.com"] });
```

### Start the worker

```tsx
// src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { worker } from "./worker";

worker.start();

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

You can also wait to start rendering your React app until the worker is ready (in case your app makes API requests on first render):

```tsx
// src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { worker } from "./worker";

worker
  .start()
  .then(() => ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root")));
```

## In an express application

You can use the `@apihero/express` middleware to add API Hero to your express application:

### Install the package

First, install the `@apihero/express` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @apihero/express@latest
```

### Add the `apihero` middleware:

```ts
import express from "express";

const app = express();
const { apiHero } = require("@apihero/express");

app.use(apiHero({ projectKey: "hero_abc123", domains: ["api.github.com"] }));
```
