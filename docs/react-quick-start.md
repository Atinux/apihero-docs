# React quick start

To use API Hero in your React app, follow the steps below.

### 1. Run the API Hero CLI

Run this in your project folder

```sh
npx apihero@latest add GitHub
```

### 2. Follow the instructions

It should guide you to:

1. Login to API Hero (creating an account if you don't have one)
2. Select the API you want to use
3. Create a project in API Hero

It will also install the required packages so you can start using the API.

### 3. Setup the ApiHeroProvider

Before you can begin making API calls, you need to wrap your app in the `ApiHeroProvider` and pass in your projectKey that you should have received from the CLI.

```jsx
export default function ExportedApp() {
  return (
    <APIHeroProvider projectKey="<Your Project Key Here>">
      <App />
    </APIHeroProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Use the API

```ts
//used to create a React hook
import { createEndpoint } from "@apihero/react";

//the api endpoint group you want to use, in this case from the GitHub integration from API Hero.
//usually I just let VSCode import everything for me
import { repos } from "@apihero/github";

const useGetRepo = createEndpoint(repos.getRepo);

export function StarCount({ owner, repo }: { owner: string; repo: string }) {
  //use the API Hero hook you created, passing in anything it expects
  const { data, status, error } = useGetRepo({ owner, repo });

  return (
    <div>
      {status === "loading" ? (
        <p>Loadingâ€¦</p>
      ) : status === "error" ? (
        <p>ðŸ«¤ {error.message}.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>{data.stargazers_count} stars</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Run your site and view the logs in API Hero

You should see every API request, including ones which failed.
It's possible that you need to add authentication for the API endpoint that you're trying to use.
