# React Quick Start

In this guide we will get you up and running using API Hero in a few minutes.

### 1. Install the API Hero js package

Install the `@apihero/js` package using your preferred package manager. Here we use npm:

```zsh
npm i @apihero/js
```

### 2. Install the worker

API Hero uses the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to forward specified traffic through a proxy server.

<Tabs groupId="install-server-worker">
<TabItem value="nextjs" label="Next.js">

Execute the following command in your project root:

```zsh
npm exec apihero-js init public/
```

You can swap out `npm` for `pnpm` or `yarn` in the command above and it will work.

### 3. Configure the worker

The final step is to configure and start the service worker.

<Tabs groupId="react-platform">
<TabItem value="next" label="Next.js">

In your root page add the following code:

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx"
// You don't need to make any changes to your components
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

//add this function
async function initProxy() {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const { setupWorker } = await import("@apihero/js");
    const worker = setupWorker({
      // You MUST supply the allow option for setupWorker, to ensure too many requests are not sent to the API Hero proxy
      allow: ["https://api.github.com/*"],
      // your project key can be found on your project page
      projectKey: "hero_123abc",
      // you only need to specify the url if you want to self-host API Hero
      //it defaults to the hosted proxy:
      //url: "https://proxy.apihero.run",
      env: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    });
    await worker.start();
  }
}

initProxy();
```

:::tip

Although it may seem unsafe, it is okay to put the `projectKey` in your code. The `projectKey` is a unique identifier for your project, and is used to authenticate with the API Hero API. It is not a secret, think of it more as a username.

:::

### 4. Run your web app to start monitoring API traffic

![My API Hero logs](/img/nodeLogs.png)

### 5. Add Authentication

Calling public GitHub endpoints without authentication info is possible but is limited to 60 requests per hour.

:::warning

GitHub rate-limits non-authenticated requests by IP address. Based on personal experience, you can easily use up an entire large office's request quota if you aren't careful!

:::

Don't worry, API Hero makes it really easy to add authentication to your API calls, without having to change a line of code!

First, head over to [GitHub's Personal access tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token to use with API Hero:

![GitHub PAT](/img/authentication/githubPAT.png)

Make sure to select the `repo` scope if you'd like to fetch data about private repositories. If not, leave the scopes blank.

After saving GitHub will show you the PAT string that you'll need to copy out for the next step:

![GitHub PAT copy](/img/authentication/githubPATcopy.png)

Head over to [app.apihero.run](https://app.apihero.run) and navigate to the project page. Click on the "Add" button in the Authentication side panel:

![API Hero Add Auth](/img/authentication/addAuth.png)

Add a Personal Access Token to your project using your GitHub username as the PAT username:

![API Hero Add PAT](/img/authentication/githubPATadd.png)

![API Hero Save PAT](/img/authentication/githubPATsave.png)

Back on the Project page, you should now see that you have 1 authentication method configured:

![Project with PAT Auth](/img/authentication/projectWithAuth.png)

Without changing your code at all, go ahead and make another request and then head back to the Request explorer page to confirm your raised rate limits:
