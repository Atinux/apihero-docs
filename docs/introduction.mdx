# What is API Hero?

<YouTubeEmbed embed="jmG41RSeGRU" />
This video shows you to how use API Hero and what it does.{" "}

---

API Hero allows you to connect to 3rd party APIs in seconds, directly from your frontend.

- Authentication information isn't exposed to users
- Caching can be flicked on with a switch (and the cache time set)
- You can view logs of every API call to track down issues

# Super quick start

### 1. Run the API Hero CLI

Run this in your project folder

```sh
npx apihero add GitHub
```

### 2. Follow the instructions

It should guide you to:

1. Login to API Hero (creating an account if you don't have one)
2. Select the API you want to use
3. Create an API Hero project

It will install the required packages so you can start coding.

### 3. Use the API

```ts
//used to create a React hook
import { createEndpoint } from "@apihero/react";

//the api endpoint group you want to use, in this case from the GitHub integration from API Hero.
//usually I just let VSCode import everything for me
import { repos } from "@apihero/github";

const useGetRepo = createEndpoint(repos.getRepo);

export function StarCount({ owner, repo }: { owner: string; repo: string }) {
  //use the API Hero hook you created, passing in anything it expects
  const { data, status, error } = useGetRepo({ owner, repo });

  return (
    <div>
      {status === "loading" ? (
        <p>Loadingâ€¦</p>
      ) : status === "error" ? (
        <p>ðŸ«¤ {error.message}.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>{data.stargazers_count} stars</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Run your site and view the logs in API Hero

![My API Hero logs](/img/logs.png)
You should see every API request, including ones which failed.
It's possible that you need to add authentication for the API endpoint that you're trying to use.

### 5. Adding API authentication
