Add full visibility of all the internal and external APIs you're using in your codebase.

# Getting started

- [Node.js quick start](/node-quick-start)
- [React quick start](/react-quick-start)

# How it works

1. You add a line of code to your Node.js app or your Javscript/TypeScript frontend. This uses a Service Worker behind-the-scenes.
2. API traffic you specify is proxied through a Cloudflare worker (they have 275 datacenters around the world ðŸ”¥)
3. The original request is forwarded on to the API; or a cached response is returned if the cache headers are present and there is a suitable cached response.
4. Both the request and response are stored in the logs service
