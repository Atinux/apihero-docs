# API Hero in 60 seconds

<YouTubeEmbed embedId="nek3WHRUwow" />

API Hero allows you to connect to 3rd party APIs in seconds, directly from your frontend.

- Authentication information isn't exposed to users
- Caching can be flicked on with a switch (and the cache time set)
- You can view logs of every API call to track down issues

This works because we proxy all API calls through the API Hero gateway, which means you can use API Hero to connect to any API, regardless of whether it supports CORS or not.
